Testing system for teachers and school children or students.

Hi, this is a Testing system, that will help teachers to create tests and students or school children to pass them.

Functionality for a student (further user):
  1. To login to the system user must register (teacher (further admin) must give him a login, that he created before). 
     After the registration user will have a login and password, which he can user later for login to the system.
  2. After login to the system user can view his previous testing results, pass a test and pass an unfinished test.
  3. The testing process can be carried out in various categories. For example, Math (category) -> Discrete Math (concrete test) ->
     Mathematical analysis (concrete test), Physics (category) -> The quantum physics (concrete test)
  4. After concluding a test user sees his testing result, a number of correct answers, the percentage of correct answers and a test score.
  5. User can interrupt a testing process and continue when it will be comfortable for him.
  
Logins and passwords of users and admin are encrypted.

Functionality for admin:
  1. In system can be only one admin. His login and password will set when he first enters the program.
  2. Further login and password of admin can be changed.
  3. Admin can add, remove and edit users.
  4. Admin can view statistics of the testing results by concrete category, by concrete test and by a concrete user. Results of view can
     be saved in .txt file.
  5. Admin can manage tests: add categories, tests and questions to them, set correct and incorrect answers, import and export categories
     from .xml and to .xml files.
     
Tests and questions to them are encrypted too.

That's all. Thanks for reading.
